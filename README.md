# Booking Classes - PoC

The main goal of this Proof of Concept is to integrate two different technologies in two different stacks. 

For the iOS side, we will integrate web content created using [Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react) into our native side using [Ionic Portals](https://ionic.io/portals).

For the Android side, we will integrate using web views.

Both projects are available in this repository, please check the different branches we've created to access the source code of each platform.

If you have any question, please let us know in the Slack channel: #webview-poc.


**Thanks for reading.**
